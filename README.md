# Web Server Penetration Testing 

## üìã Executive Summary

The penetration test conducted on the **CertifiedHacker Networks** ([certifiedhacker.com](https://certifiedhacker.com)) web server and e-commerce application has provided valuable insights into the system's security vulnerabilities. The primary focus of the test was to assess the web server's and application's resilience against potential cyber threats and identify areas for improvement.

The findings revealed critical vulnerabilities:

*  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Exploitable flaw allowing arbitrary script execution
*  **Missing Security Headers**: Including absence of HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, and X-Frame-Options
*  **Directory Traversal**: Vulnerability allowing access to unauthorized directories

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools Used

* Burp Suite
* OWASP ZAP
* Nikto
* curl
* Firefox Developer Tools
* Kali Linux
* etc

## üß™ Methodology

1. **Reconnaissance**: Collected publicly available information on the target
2. **Scanning and Enumeration**: Identified open ports, technologies, and endpoints
3. **Vulnerability Detection**: Manual and automated tools to find XSS, misconfigurations, etc.
4. **Exploitation**: Demonstrated proof-of-concept for discovered flaws
5. **Reporting and Recommendations**: Documented findings and proposed mitigations

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Findings & Recommendations

### 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

* **Description**: The application accepted user input without proper encoding, enabling arbitrary script execution.
* **Recommendation**: Implement strict input validation, output encoding, and Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.

### 2. Missing Security Headers

* **Description**: Absence of security headers like:

  * `Strict-Transport-Security`
  * `X-Content-Type-Options`
  * `X-Frame-Options`
* **Recommendation**:

  * Enable **HSTS** to enforce HTTPS
  * Set **X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff**
  * Use **X-Frame-Options: DENY** to prevent clickjacking

### 3. Directory Traversal

* **Description**: Improper handling of file paths allowed traversal beyond the web root.
* **Recommendation**:

  * Whitelist allowed file paths
  * Sanitize input paths
  * Set strict file permissions

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Hardening Suggestions

* Perform **regular vulnerability scans** and patch known issues
* Adopt **Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** practices
* Conduct **security awareness training** for development teams
* Monitor server and application logs for suspicious activity

## üéì Learning Outcomes

* Gained practical experience in web application penetration testing
* Improved proficiency in tools like Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, and Nikto
* Developed deeper understanding of secure coding practices
* Reinforced importance of ethical conduct in cybersecurity research

## üßæ Conclusion

Implementing the proposed security enhancements will significantly improve the resilience of **CertifiedHacker Networks** against common web application threats. The project has not only strengthened my technical skills but also highlighted the critical importance of ongoing vigilance in maintaining cybersecurity.
